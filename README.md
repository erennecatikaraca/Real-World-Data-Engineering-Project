---Uber & Fare Data Streaming Simulation on Microsoft Fabric---

**A simulated real-time data streaming project using Microsoft Fabric and PySpark, inspired by Uber ride and fare data.**

## Project Overview

This project simulates Uber ride and fare data streams using CSV files stored in Google Drive, mimicking real-time streaming scenarios. Data is ingested, cleaned, and transformed in a **Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold** layered architecture using Microsoft Fabric, PySpark, and Lakehouse storage. The final Gold layer is structured for analytics with Power BI.
## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

## Bronze Layer

- **Source:** 6 CSV files in Google Drive (3 files about fares, 3 about Uber rides).  
- **Simulation:** Python code reads these files at scheduled intervals to mimic streaming data.  
- **Destination:** Data is stored in Lakehouse as **two separate raw tables**: `raw_data` (ride info) and `raw_fare` (fare info).  
- **Objective:** Capture raw streaming-like data for initial ingestion.

---

## Silver Layer

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Remove duplicates  
  - Handle null values  
  - Correct date formats  
- **Merging:** The two raw tables (`raw_data` and `raw_fare`) are merged into a single cleaned table: `cleaned_silver_trips`.  
- **Objective:** Produce a clean, consistent dataset ready for analytics.

---

## Gold Layer

- **Transformation:**  
  - Using **Data Flow Gen2**, create **Fact** and **Dimension** tables based on the cleaned Silver layer.  
  - Implement a **Star Schema** for efficient analytics.  
- **Destination:** Fabric Warehouse, optimized for Power BI dashboards and reports.  
- **Objective:** Make high-quality, query-ready data available for business analysis and visualization.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Fabric** (Data Factory, Lakehouse, Warehouse)  
- **PySpark** for ETL and transformations  
- **Python** for streaming simulation from Google Drive CSV files  
- **Power BI** for visualization and analytics

## Power BI Analysis

After the Gold layer, the data is fully **cleaned, transformed, and modeled** into a **Star Schema** with Fact and Dimension tables. At this stage, the dataset becomes reliable, consistent, and ready for business intelligence.

Using **Power BI**, we connected directly to the Fabric Warehouse and built dashboards that provide:

-  **Operational Insights:** Daily/weekly ride volumes, fare trends, and demand fluctuations.  
-  **Business Metrics:** Driver activity, trip durations, peak hours, and location-based ride patterns.  
-  **Financial Analysis:** Revenue distribution, average fare per trip, and seasonal profitability trends.  
-  **Future Planning:** By analyzing historical patterns, the company can forecast demand, optimize driver allocation, and improve pricing strategies.  

This layer demonstrates how **raw data ‚Üí cleaned data ‚Üí business-ready insights** can empower decision-makers.  
With the integration of Microsoft Fabric and Power BI, stakeholders gain a **single source of truth** for analytics, enabling strategic planning and evidence-based decision-making for future growth.
